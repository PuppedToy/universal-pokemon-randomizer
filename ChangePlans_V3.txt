Unit Tests
Gen 4/Gen 5 multiple LEVEL_ITEM_DAY should ensure items are different
Docker for building JAR and making into EXE
Custom ROM Options Pane to restrict Pokemon Size (only randomize the pokemon from 1 to given limit like 160)
Replace evo with same stage evo (base for base, middle stage for middle stage)
Randomize headbutt tree encounters in HGSS (works in gen 2 not gen 4)
RandomizerGUI romLoaded state matches new Settings object
Trainer Options to new class
Starter Options to new class
Evolution Options to new class
randomizable_809 ROM support for Fairy type (maybe just set fairy to 0x17, ideally parse a types table and align)
Move ROMEntry to separate Class
Move RomHandler state to Model Class
Change Settings toString and fromString to refer to a separate list. Try to make saving options easier when adding new options
Gen4 Trades should use new pokemon (still uses old pokemon)
Gen4 leader TM should use new names
Trainer Class Names should be gender based (Rich Boy woman not allowed) (group all trainer names and determine a 1-1 swap)
Signature Move - All leaders have a signature move on all pokes (same as TM?)
Type by ace (one of dual type, or if mono type, keeps mono) (keep type but change team)
RSE Gen 3 - Patch both Arco and Mach
Redo code to use PokemonSet
TM text updates for Gen 5 (use new names)
Trainer pokemon evolve at appropriate level (if at level, evolve. if not, unevolve. non-level base off bst)
Select full team instead of only starter (is it possible to prestock a pc?)
Shift abilities to left or right instead of randomizing (thus activating hidden abilities)
Enable patching randomization formulas
Evolution level randomized into a range based on the resulting BST
Randomize attack effects (romHandler.saveMoves)
Move prefixes (DEFDN-Leer)
Add PokemonEmerald Party Randomizer

All versions to 200
Update settings updater
Verify docs
Update premade settings
Move options around so non-visible options are at bottom (particularly trainer and starter)
Build exe and zip into github
