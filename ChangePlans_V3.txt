* Everything evolves at level 1 (constant evolution)
* Fix trainer level modifier to be enabled regardless of whether unchanged is selected for trainer mod
* Investigate AI level increase / change
* Investigate EV/IV application - Based on AI. No EVs.
* Investigate Shiny rate - Instruction set sets rate at Rate/65535, with max rate being FF (255), thus max is 1/257 or ~0.3891% - https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/7hrnhi/guide_how_to_change_the_shiny_rate_in_platinum/
* Remove Rotom from legendary pool
* Fix Platinum Battle Tower rival not sharing team when "Carries Team" is active (teams #923, #924 and #925)
* Fix AllowLowLevelEvolutions setting so it actually toggles the filtering
* Gen 4/Gen 5 multiple LEVEL_ITEM_DAY should ensure items are different
* (UI too difficult) Custom ROM Options Pane to restrict Pokemon Size (only randomize the pokemon from 1 to given limit like 160)
* Read from file to restrict Pokemon Size (only randomize the pokemon from given min to given max)
* Replace evo with same stage evo (base for base, middle stage for middle stage)
* Disable legendary evolutions when randomizing evolutions
* Randomize headbutt tree encounters in HGSS (works in gen 2 not gen 4, see https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/commit/c1f278fd13bf0ac23f9ed20f638b8c8754b4f348)
* Fix HGSS wild encounters having no backgorund
* Add dark mode
* Fix randomStarter logging to use min evos and either + or exact as header (2evos+ or 2evos exact)
* Update Type Effectiveness to Gen 8 (https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/n0xsrl/version_190_of_universal_pokemon_randomizer/h54tvei?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* randomizable_809 ROM support for Fairy type (maybe just set fairy to 0x17, ideally parse a types table and align)
* Type Strong Against and Weak Against based on rom values (supports hack changes)
* Output type chart
* Refactor templating data into static class (Must reset when rom loads)
Refactor STRONG_AGAINST/RESISTANT_TO to be a table (need to be able to get all types and differentiate between 0 and 0.5)
Fix initial starter list getting ignored (while starters.contains(pkmn) always true on first round)
Investigate if there is a better SE triangle algorithm (go against something that is planned to be kept rather than replaced)
---------------
RandomizerGUI romLoaded state matches new Settings object
All fields should be private and only accessible through getters/setters
Trainer Options to new class
Starter Options to new class
Evolution Options to new class
All other group options to new class
Move ROMEntry to separate Class
Move RomHandler state to Model Class
Change Settings toString and fromString to refer to a separate list. Try to make saving options easier when adding new options
Try to automatically create all boilerplate settings code (get setting, set setting, from string, to string, initial form state, enable or disable, rom loaded, etc)
Redo code to use PokemonSet
Redo Gen4 WriteEncounters to not use iterator
Unit Tests use common data model
Unit tests deterministic (random should print seed and be sourced from manually input seed)
Unit test more GenRestrictions
Unit test RomEntry
Replace versioning system with more robust model (190 -> 1100 is stupid, maybe find maven package for versioning)
Add docstrings to all functions
Remove all warnings
Possible Options - Code coverage, code quality lint
---------------
Randomize roaming pokemon in Gen 3+ (https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/n0xsrl/version_190_of_universal_pokemon_randomizer/h4iiwzw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
Gen4 Trades should use new pokemon (still uses old pokemon)
Gen4 leader TM should use new names
TM text updates for Gen 5 (use new names)
List new item locations (where can dragonscale be found)
Docker for building JAR and making into EXE
Gym leader / E4 pokemon should have better movesets (2 moves same type max, 1 status move, 1 move from outside last 4 learned)
Change AI levels for Gen 3 - 5
-- Gen 3 4 5 only. Set under TrainerPokemon as AILevel
-- Gen 3 - 0 to 250 (probably could do 255)
-- Gen 4 - 0 to 250 (probably could do 255)
-- Gen 5 - 0 to 250 (probably could do 255)
Trainer Class Names should be gender based (Rich Boy woman not allowed) (group all trainer names and determine a 1-1 swap)
Signature Move - All leaders have a signature move on all pokes (same as TM?)
Type by ace (one of dual type, or if mono type, keeps mono) (keep type but change team)
Magikarp Mode (everything is magikarp, everyone has hyper beam, and all text is changed to MAGIKARP)
RSE Gen 3 - Patch both Arco and Mach
Trainer pokemon evolve at appropriate level (if at level, evolve. if not, unevolve. non-level base off bst)
Select full team instead of only starter (is it possible to prestock a pc?)
Shift abilities to left or right instead of randomizing (thus activating hidden abilities)
Enable patching randomization formulas
Evolution level randomized into a range based on the resulting BST
Randomize attack effects (romHandler.saveMoves)
Move prefixes (DEFDN-Leer)
Add PokemonEmerald Party Randomizer
Platinum rival gets random replacement for Heracross when "Carries Team" is active

All versions to 1100
Update settings updater
Verify docs
Update premade settings
Move options around so non-visible options are at bottom (particularly trainer and starter)
Build exe and zip into github
